## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming, professional blue (#5DADE2) to inspire trust and competence. The concept driving the selection of this primary color is 'trust'.
- Background color: A light, neutral grey (#F0F4F7) to provide a clean, modern backdrop and ensure readability. This suits the light color scheme.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#78E08F) to highlight key actions and elements, symbolizing opportunity. Its luminosity allows it to stand out against the calm blue and neutral background, but its hue is related to the primary color, due to it being an adjacent color on the color wheel.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for all text elements to ensure clarity and ease of use.
- A card-based layout to clearly present job listings and resume insights.
- Subtle transition animations to enhance user experience when navigating between sections and loading data.
